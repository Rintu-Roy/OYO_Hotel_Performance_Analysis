# OYO_Hotel_Performance_Analysis

Introduction:


In this project, I am conducting a comprehensive analysis of hotel booking and cancellation data to understand 
the patterns, trends, and impact on the business over some time. The dataset contains valuable insights 
into the performance of OYO Hotels, a prominent player in the hospitality industry. By delving into this data, 
we aim to uncover key findings that will help us make informed decisions and optimize the hotel's operations.


Project Objectives:


Identify Booking and Cancellation Trends: We will explore the historical data to identify trends in hotel bookings and cancellations over time.
This will include analyzing monthly and weekly patterns, as well as any seasonal variations.

Hotel Type Performance:


We will assess the performance of different hotel types, such as City Hotels and Resort Hotels. 
By comparing booking and cancellation statistics, we can gain insights into which hotel types are performing better.
Guest Behavior Analysis: Understanding the behaviour of different guest types (e.g., Couples, Families, Groups, and singles) is crucial. 
We will investigate their preferences, booking habits, and how they contribute to cancellations.


Room Assignment Impact: We will analyze the impact of room-type assignments on booking cancellations. 
This includes examining Assigned and unassigned room types and their influence on customer satisfaction.
Business Implications: By uncovering cancellation trends and their impact, we will provide valuable insights that can guide decision-making within the OYO Hotel business.
This may include recommendations for improving booking and cancellation rates.

Methodology:

The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel, utilizing various pivot tables and formulas to examine booking and cancellation data from OYO hotels.



Conclusion:


Drawing from my own experience and the insights gained from this analysis, it's clear that ensuring strong credibility 
with OYO partner hotels is crucial for reducing cancellations and increasing bookings. Customers often express frustration 
when they encounter difficulties with their OYO bookings, such as hotels not honouring reservations or attempting to persuade guests to cancel and rebook directly.

To address this issue and improve the overall customer experience, OYO must take proactive steps to strengthen its partnerships with associated hotels. 
This can be achieved through the following measures:


Solution:

Credibility with Partners:

  
The analysis highlights the critical importance of OYO maintaining a strong and credible relationship with its partner hotels.
Instances, where hotels fail to honour OYO reservations or try to persuade guests to cancel and rebook independently, can lead to customer frustration and booking cancellations.
To address this issue, OYO must prioritize open communication, training, and quality assurance with partner hotels.

Proactive Measures:

To minimize booking cancellations and improve the overall customer experience, OYO should take proactive steps.
This includes enhancing communication, educating partner hotels, and providing incentives for excellent service.
By implementing these measures, OYO can increase customer satisfaction, boost bookings, and establish itself as a reliable choice in the hospitality industry.
